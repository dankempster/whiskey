# Whiskey

A blend of (parts of) several [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) projects.

 - [DoCSSa's](http://docssa.info) methodology, arcitecture and the system mixins (importOnce, _add, _use),
 - [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io) for the base variables and structure (although we've modified it a bit),
 - [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io) to genertae semantic grids,
 - [Refills](http://refills.bourbon.io) for pre-packaged component styles,
 - [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) for useful Mixins (and it's a dependancy of Bitters, Neat & Refills)
 - [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) isn't it obvious?

The purpose of this project is to provide the Bourbon suite the DoCCSa way, eventually. Who knows, it may even
evolve into a starter kit.
